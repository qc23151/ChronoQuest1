# Chronoquest

**Chronoquest** is a 10 minute retro 2D action-adventure game built around time manipulation, fast paced combat, and adaptive enemies. The player explores a dungeon, fights through hostile enemies, and uses time rewind magic to survive increasingly challenging situations. The game is designed as a focused experience that can be completed in a single playthrough, with an emphasis on learning, experimentation, and replayability.

## Core Experience
At its heart, Chronoquest combines responsive combat with strategic decision-making. Defeating enemies earns mana, which can be spent on powerful abilities such as rewinding time. Rewind allows players to undo recent mistakes, reposition themselves, or escape dangerous situations,encouraging players to take risks, learn enemy patterns, and recover from errors without breaking the flow of gameplay. By tying rewind to mana earned through combat, the system rewards skillful play while maintaining tension and challenge forcing players to use it thoughtfully rather than rely upon it constantly.

## Enemies and AI
Enemies in Chronoquest are designed to feel aware and reactive. Rather than acting in isolation, enemies can coordinate their behaviour, applying pressure, flanking the player, or supporting one another during fights. As the player progresses, encounters become more demanding, requiring smart use of abilities and positioning rather than simple repetition.

## The Final Challenge
The game culminates in a boss encounter that adapts to the player’s playstyle. By observing the players playstyle, the boss uses a strategy that will best counter the players tendencies, encouraging players to vary their strategies and think creatively.

## Art and Presentation
Chronoquest uses pixel art with a clean, readable visual style. Characters and environments are designed to clearly communicate gameplay information while maintaining a cohesive aesthetic. 

## Project Goals
Chronoquest aims to deliver:
- A unique time based mechanic that meaningfully affects gameplay  
- Engaging combat that rewards learning and experimentation  
- Adaptive and cooperative enemy behaviour  
- A polished, complete experience within a small scope  

This project focuses on strong system interaction, clear design goals, and technical ambition balanced with achievable development constraints.
